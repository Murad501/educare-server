    "description": "C is often considered to be the mother of all languages because so many other languages have been based on it. Though C is simple it is one of the most powerful languages ever created.  Considering it was created over 40 years ago, it is still used heavily and is usually in the top 5 or 10 most popular and most widely programming languages in the world. Learning C can actually make you a better programming in other languages like C++, Java, or C# by equipping you with a mental model of what the computer is actually doing when you run your programs. By learning how things really work under the hood, and understand memory space, CPU architecture and so on, you can create more efficient programs, and obtain a huge advantage over other programmers in the process.If you want to become a better developer, learning C is a great way to start!.",

    "description": "This course is intended for absolute beginners to programming OR those who don't mind a slower pace to learning Java. If you're looking for a faster-paced course, this may not be for you (though you can play back at 2x speed & may still find great things to learn). Also, even for those who already know some basic Java, you could skip over the parts you already know and focus on those you may not, like Regex, Streams/Lambdas API, Optionals, Date/Time, SQL/Database/JDBC sections that even seasoned Java developers may not know as well as they should. Many of my sections on these APIs are as long or longer than MANY stand-alone courses dedicated to just one of these topics - for similar prices. Check out my preview videos from each of those sections to gauge how deep I go into each topic.",

    "description": "The topics covered include Object Orientation which I think is not stressed enough in other Java courses so I've got special focus on that throughout the lectures. You'll get plenty of practice writing classes and interfaces as well as countless methods with loops and if else statements, exception handling and file processing as well as how to debug software using Eclipse. You'll also be mastering the collections framework and diving deep into java generics. You'll learn all there is to know about multi-threading and the JDBC API for working with a MySQL database. There are also practical projects scattered throughout the course so that you can practice the concepts as you learn them. For example one of the projects is related to a car dealership management system and another assignment involves processing files with stock market data. So as you can see, I tried to keep the projects professional and industry relevant rather than cloning a game like flappy bird.",
